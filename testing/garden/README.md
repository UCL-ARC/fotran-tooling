# garden

[Garden](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/garden) is a unit testing framework for testing serial or parallel Fortran codes.
It has a sister project called [veggies](https://gitlab.com/everythingfunctional/veggies) which acts as the same testing framework
but for serial only codes. *"The hope is that at some point in the future all compilers will support parallel features implicitly, and any need for two separate packages will disappear."*
